# Data Analysis Processes with SQL - COVID-19 Death and Vaccination Rates

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts and guidelines for performing data analysis on COVID-19 death and vaccination rates. The goal of this project is to provide a step-by-step process for analyzing and visualizing data related to COVID-19 using SQL and Tableau.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Our World in Data, specifically the COVID-19 deaths dataset. The dataset provides information on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates for various countries and regions. You can access the dataset through the following link: [COVID-19 Deaths Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

## SQL Scripts

The repository includes the following SQL scripts:

1. `data_exploration`: This script explores the structure and content of the COVID-19 deaths dataset. It examines the column types, performs basic statistical analyses, and identifies any data quality issues.

2. `data_analysis`: This script conducts various analyses on the cleaned dataset. It explores trends, calculates summary statistics, performs aggregations, and generates insights related to COVID-19 death and vaccination rates.

3. `data_visualization`: This script demonstrates how to export the analyzed data from SQL to Tableau. It formats the data appropriately and exports it to a format compatible with Tableau for further visualization.

## Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard for visualizing the COVID-19 death and vaccination rates can be accessed through the following link: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yusuf.arcan.demirel/viz/CovidDashboard_202306/Dashboard1).

The Tableau dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing the data visually. It includes interactive charts, maps, and filters that allow users to gain insights into COVID-19 trends and vaccination rates across different countries and regions.

## Usage

To use the SQL scripts and Tableau dashboard:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Set up a database environment with a SQL server that supports the scripts (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

3. Download the COVID-19 deaths dataset from the provided link and import it into your database.

4. Open each SQL script in a SQL editor or client of your choice.

5. Modify the script if necessary, such as changing table or column names to match your dataset.

6. Run each script sequentially, following the order mentioned above.

7. Review the output and make sure the data cleaning and analysis processes were successful.

8. Access the Tableau dashboard through the provided link and interact with the visualizations to explore COVID-19 death and vaccination rates.

## Dependencies

To use the SQL scripts, you need to have a working knowledge of SQL and have access to a SQL server or database environment. Additionally, you should download the COVID-19 deaths dataset from the provided link and import it into your database.

To interact with the Tableau dashboard, you need to have Tableau software installed or use the Tableau Public platform to access the provided dashboard link.
